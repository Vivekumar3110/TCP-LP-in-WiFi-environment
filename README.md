# TCP-LP-in-WiFi-environment
## Exhaustive evaluation of TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP) in WiFi environments </br>

**Brief:** TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP), a distributed algorithm whose goal is to utilize only the excess network bandwidth as compared to the “fair share” of bandwidth as targeted by TCP.[1] This assignment aims to thoroughy evaluate the performance of TCP-LP in WiFi environments, including Gigabit
WiFi, with and without Rate Adaptation.</br>

**Required experience:** C and C++</br>

**Bonus experience:** Fundamentals of TCP-LP and ns-3</br>

**Difficulty:** Moderate</br>
