# TCP-LP-in-WiFi-environment
## Exhaustive evaluation of TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP) in WiFi environments </br>

**Application:**
One class of applications of TCP-LP is low-priority file
transfer over the Internet. For network clients on low-speed
access links, TCP-LP provides a mechanism to retain faster
response times for interactive applications using TCP, while
simultaneously making progress on background file transfers
using TCP-LP. Similarly, in enterprise networks, TCP-LP enables large file backups to proceed without impeding interactive applications, a functionality that would otherwise require
a multi-priority or separate network..</br>
