# TCP-LP-in-WiFi-environment
## Exhaustive evaluation of TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP) in WiFi environments

**Brief:** TCP Low Priority is Less than Best Effort (LBE) transport, similar to LEDBAT. This
project aims to evaluate the performance of TCP-LP in WiFi environments, including Gigabit
WiFi, with and without Rate Adaptation.
**Required experience:** C and C++
**Bonus experience:** Fundamentals of TCP-LP and ns-3
**Difficulty:** Moderate
